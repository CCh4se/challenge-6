# Description
For this challenege we were tasked with creating a website that allows us to access Server Side APIs and implement them into the content we use. The code we emplemented needed us to be able to search for a city, view the current weather conditions for the city that was searched, view the future weather conditions, and to be able to click on the previous cities in the search history. Specically for the weather search, the user should be able to see the weather condition (via an icon), the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. I definetly to meet with a tutor this following week to brush up on all of this and get a better understanding of Server Side APIs.
